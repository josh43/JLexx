     compress makes the DFA compressed which saved a ton of memory, on simple DFA's for example

     The downfall is that when moving on states turns into

     jumpTable[currentSate][inputCharacter] == some state
     but on compression its
     u_char compressedIndex = compressState.binSearch(inputCharacter);
     return jumpTable[currentState][compressedIndex];
